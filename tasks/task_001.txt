# Task ID: 1
# Title: Design Agent Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design the overall architecture for integrating agent-based approach into the existing RAG system following DDD+CQRS principles.
# Details:
Create a detailed architecture design document that outlines:
1. Agent component structure and interfaces
2. Integration points with existing RAG system
3. State management for multi-step interactions
4. Action type definitions and interfaces
5. Event flow diagrams for agent decision making
6. Domain model updates to support agent functionality

Ensure the design follows existing DDD+CQRS architecture and maintains backward compatibility with existing interfaces. Define clear boundaries between the agent subsystem and the core RAG functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Review the architecture design with stakeholders. Create test scenarios that validate the architecture can support all required agent actions and self-assessment mechanisms. Verify compatibility with existing system through interface analysis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Agent Domain Model and Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core domain model for the agent subsystem including entity definitions, value objects, and interfaces that will be used throughout the architecture.
### Details:
Define the following components: Agent entity with properties and behaviors, AgentAction value objects, AgentState entity, Decision interfaces, and integration interfaces with the RAG system. Ensure all models follow DDD principles with proper aggregates, entities, and value objects. Document the domain events that will flow between the agent subsystem and RAG system.

## 2. Design Command and Query Handlers for Agent Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Define the CQRS command and query handlers that will manage agent operations, including decision making, state transitions, and interaction with the RAG system.
### Details:
Create command handlers for: InitiateAgent, UpdateAgentState, ExecuteAgentAction, and TerminateAgent. Design query handlers for: GetAgentState, GetAvailableActions, and GetAgentHistory. Ensure proper separation between command and query responsibilities. Document the event flow between handlers and how they interact with the domain model.

## 3. Design State Management System for Multi-step Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create a state management system that handles the persistence and retrieval of agent state during multi-step interactions with users.
### Details:
Design a state repository interface and implementation that can store and retrieve agent state efficiently. Define state transition rules and validation logic. Create a state history tracking mechanism for auditing and rollback capabilities. Ensure the state management system can handle concurrent interactions and maintain consistency. Document how state is persisted between user interactions.

## 4. Design Integration Points with Existing RAG System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Define the integration architecture between the new agent subsystem and the existing RAG system, ensuring backward compatibility and clear boundaries.
### Details:
Create adapter interfaces that translate between agent domain models and RAG domain models. Design service interfaces for the RAG system to invoke agent functionality. Define event subscribers that react to RAG system events. Document the data flow between systems and any necessary transformation logic. Ensure the integration maintains the existing RAG system's performance characteristics.

## 5. Create Comprehensive Architecture Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Compile all design decisions into a comprehensive architecture document with diagrams, interface definitions, and implementation guidelines.
### Details:
Create UML diagrams showing the agent component structure, class relationships, and sequence diagrams for key operations. Document all interfaces with method signatures and parameter descriptions. Create event flow diagrams showing the decision-making process. Provide implementation guidelines for developers. Include a section on migration strategy from the current system. Document any performance considerations or potential bottlenecks.
