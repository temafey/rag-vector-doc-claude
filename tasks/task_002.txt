# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Agent Core Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core agent framework that will orchestrate the decision-making process and action execution.
# Details:
Implement the core agent framework with the following components:
1. AgentContext class to maintain state between interactions
2. ActionRegistry for registering and retrieving available actions
3. AgentOrchestrator to manage the agent lifecycle and decision flow
4. AgentMemory for storing conversation history and intermediate results
5. ActionExecutor for executing selected actions

Code structure should follow:
```python
class AgentContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = AgentMemory()
        self.current_state = {}
        self.action_history = []

class ActionRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.actions = {}
    
    def register_action(self, action_type, action_handler):
        self.actions[action_type] = action_handler
    
    def get_action(self, action_type):
        return self.actions.get(action_type)

class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, action_registry):
        self.action_registry = action_registry
    
    def process_request(self, user_query, context):
        # Determine actions needed
        # Execute actions
        # Return result
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each component of the agent framework. Test the orchestrator with mock actions to verify correct execution flow. Implement integration tests that validate the agent can maintain state across multiple interactions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement AgentContext and AgentMemory Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the AgentContext class to maintain state between interactions and the AgentMemory class for storing conversation history and intermediate results.
### Details:
Implement the AgentContext class with initialization of memory, current_state, and action_history. Create the AgentMemory class with methods for adding entries, retrieving conversation history, and storing/retrieving intermediate results. Include methods for serialization and deserialization of the context state for persistence between sessions.

## 2. Develop ActionRegistry with Registration System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ActionRegistry class that allows for registering and retrieving available actions that the agent can perform.
### Details:
Implement the ActionRegistry with methods for registering actions with their types and handlers, retrieving actions by type, listing all available actions, and validating action handlers. Include support for action metadata and documentation to enable dynamic discovery of capabilities.

## 3. Build ActionExecutor Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the ActionExecutor class responsible for safely executing selected actions and handling their results.
### Details:
Create the ActionExecutor with methods to execute actions retrieved from the ActionRegistry. Implement error handling, timeout management, and result processing. Include support for asynchronous action execution and proper resource cleanup after execution.

## 4. Implement AgentOrchestrator Core Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop the AgentOrchestrator class that manages the agent lifecycle and decision flow, connecting all components together.
### Details:
Implement the process_request method to handle user queries by determining required actions, executing them in the proper sequence, and updating the context. Add support for decision-making logic to select appropriate actions based on the query and context. Include hooks for pre/post processing of requests and responses.

## 5. Create Agent Configuration and Factory System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a configuration and factory system to instantiate and configure the agent framework components with different settings.
### Details:
Create an AgentConfig class to hold configuration parameters. Implement an AgentFactory that can create properly configured instances of AgentContext, ActionRegistry, ActionExecutor, and AgentOrchestrator. Support loading configurations from files or environment variables. Include validation of configurations to ensure all required parameters are provided.
