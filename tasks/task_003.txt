# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Action Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the required action types that the agent can perform, including search, generation, evaluation, clarification, planning, and research.
# Details:
Create concrete implementations for each action type specified in the requirements:

1. SearchAction - for retrieving information from vector database
```python
class SearchAction:
    def __init__(self, vector_db_client):
        self.vector_db_client = vector_db_client
    
    def execute(self, query, context):
        results = self.vector_db_client.search(query)
        context.memory.add_search_results(results)
        return results
```

2. GenerateAction - for generating responses based on context
3. EvaluateAction - for assessing response quality
4. ClarifyAction - for requesting clarification from users
5. PlanAction - for breaking down complex tasks
6. ResearchAction - for finding additional information

Each action should implement a common interface with execute() method and should integrate with the existing Qdrant vector database and LangChain components.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each action type with mock dependencies. Test each action with various inputs to ensure correct behavior. Create integration tests that combine multiple actions to solve complex queries. Verify that actions correctly interact with the vector database and language models.
