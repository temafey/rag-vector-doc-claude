# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Self-Assessment Mechanism
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the self-assessment mechanism that evaluates generated responses based on the specified criteria.
# Details:
Implement a self-assessment module with the following components:

1. ResponseEvaluator class that assesses responses on multiple criteria:
```python
class ResponseEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, llm_client):
        self.llm_client = llm_client
    
    def evaluate(self, query, response, context):
        scores = {
            'relevance': self._evaluate_relevance(query, response),
            'factual_accuracy': self._evaluate_factual_accuracy(response, context),
            'completeness': self._evaluate_completeness(query, response),
            'logical_coherence': self._evaluate_logical_coherence(response),
            'ethical_compliance': self._evaluate_ethical_compliance(response)
        }
        return scores, self._calculate_overall_score(scores)
```

2. Implement evaluation methods for each criterion using prompt engineering with LLMs
3. Create a configuration system for setting quality thresholds
4. Implement a decision mechanism to determine if response improvement is needed

Use LangChain to create specialized prompts for each evaluation criterion.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test suite with sample queries and responses of varying quality. Validate that the evaluator correctly identifies issues in responses. Test with edge cases like very short responses, off-topic responses, and factually incorrect responses. Compare evaluator results with human judgments for a subset of test cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ResponseEvaluator Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure of the ResponseEvaluator class with initialization and the main evaluate method that will call individual criterion evaluation methods.
### Details:
Create the ResponseEvaluator class with __init__ method that accepts an LLM client. Implement the evaluate method that calls placeholder methods for each criterion (relevance, factual_accuracy, completeness, logical_coherence, ethical_compliance) and returns a dictionary of scores along with an overall score. Include a _calculate_overall_score method that computes a weighted average of individual scores.

## 2. Implement Individual Criterion Evaluation Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the specific evaluation methods for each assessment criterion using LangChain to create specialized prompts.
### Details:
Implement the five evaluation methods (_evaluate_relevance, _evaluate_factual_accuracy, _evaluate_completeness, _evaluate_logical_coherence, _evaluate_ethical_compliance). Each method should use LangChain to create a specialized prompt that asks the LLM to evaluate the response on that specific criterion. Design prompts that clearly explain what each criterion means and how to score it on a scale (e.g., 1-10). Return a normalized score for each criterion.

## 3. Create Configuration System for Quality Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a configuration system that allows setting and adjusting quality thresholds for each evaluation criterion.
### Details:
Create a QualityConfig class that stores threshold values for each criterion and the overall score. Implement methods to load configurations from a file (JSON/YAML), set default values, and validate configurations. Modify the ResponseEvaluator to accept a QualityConfig object and use its thresholds when evaluating responses. Include the ability to adjust weights for different criteria in the overall score calculation.

## 4. Implement Decision Mechanism for Response Improvement [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system that determines whether a response needs improvement based on evaluation scores and thresholds.
### Details:
Add a needs_improvement method to ResponseEvaluator that compares each criterion score and the overall score against the configured thresholds. Return a boolean indicating if improvement is needed, along with a list of criteria that failed to meet thresholds. Implement a get_improvement_suggestions method that generates specific feedback on how to improve the response for each failing criterion.

## 5. Integrate Self-Assessment with Response Generation Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the self-assessment mechanism with the response generation system to create a complete feedback loop.
### Details:
Create an enhanced response generation pipeline that includes self-assessment. Implement a generate_with_assessment method that generates a response, evaluates it, and if needed, regenerates improved responses until quality thresholds are met or a maximum number of attempts is reached. Add logging of assessment scores and improvement attempts. Include a mechanism to return both the final response and its quality metrics to the caller.
