# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Agent State Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the state management system for maintaining agent state between interactions.
# Details:
Create a state management system for the agent:

1. Design and implement state persistence:
```python
class AgentStateRepository:
    def __init__(self, db_client):
        self.db_client = db_client
    
    def save_state(self, conversation_id, state):
        # Serialize and save state
        pass
    
    def load_state(self, conversation_id):
        # Load and deserialize state
        pass
```

2. Implement conversation history tracking
3. Create mechanisms for state recovery in case of failures
4. Implement state cleanup for completed or abandoned conversations
5. Add state migration capabilities for handling version changes
6. Ensure thread safety for concurrent operations

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for state serialization/deserialization. Test state persistence and recovery with various state sizes and complexities. Test concurrent access patterns. Verify state cleanup works correctly. Test recovery from simulated failures.
