Edge case testing:\n   - Test with conflicting manual edits to memory bank files\n   - Test with missing or malformed memory bank files\n   - Test with various types of code changes (new features, refactors, dependency updates)\n   - Test with large volumes of changes\n\n4. Validation criteria:\n   - All specified memory bank files are updated\n   - Content is accurate and reflects the current state of the project\n   - Formatting and structure of the files is preserved\n   - No manual edits are lost unless explicitly configured\n   - The process completes within a reasonable time frame\n\n5.
