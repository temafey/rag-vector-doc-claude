# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing for the agent-based RAG system.
# Details:
Create comprehensive test suite:

1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance tests for measuring system under load
5. Regression tests for existing functionality
6. Create test fixtures and factories:
```python
class TestFixtures:
    @staticmethod
    def create_test_query():
        return "What is the capital of France?"
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_test_context():
        context = AgentContext()
        context.memory.add_fact("France is a country in Europe.")
        context.memory.add_fact("Paris is the capital of France.")
        return context
```

7. Implement test automation for CI/CD pipeline
8. Add code coverage reporting

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tests pass consistently. Measure code coverage and ensure it meets targets. Test on different environments to ensure compatibility. Verify test automation works correctly in CI/CD pipeline.
