# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations to minimize the impact of agent functionality on system performance.
# Details:
Optimize performance of the agent system:

1. Implement caching for expensive operations:
```python
class ResponseCache:
    def __init__(self, cache_client):
        self.cache_client = cache_client
    
    def get_cached_response(self, query_hash):
        return self.cache_client.get(f"response:{query_hash}")
    
    def cache_response(self, query_hash, response, ttl=3600):
        self.cache_client.set(f"response:{query_hash}", response, ttl)
```

2. Add asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
3. Implement batching for database operations
4. Add result pagination for large result sets
5. Optimize prompt templates to reduce token usage
6. Implement resource pooling for external services
7. Add request throttling and rate limiting

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing with various load patterns. Measure response times before and after optimizations. Test cache hit rates under different scenarios. Verify asynchronous processing works correctly. Test system behavior under high load.
