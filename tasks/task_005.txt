# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Response Improvement Mechanism
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the mechanism for automatically improving responses that don't meet the quality threshold.
# Details:
Implement a response improvement system with the following components:

1. ResponseImprover class that analyzes evaluation results and selects improvement strategies:
```python
class ResponseImprover:
    def __init__(self, action_registry):
        self.action_registry = action_registry
    
    def improve_response(self, query, response, evaluation_results, context):
        improvement_strategy = self._select_strategy(evaluation_results)
        improved_response = self._apply_strategy(improvement_strategy, query, response, context)
        return improved_response
```

2. Implement improvement strategies:
   - ContextEnrichmentStrategy - fetches additional context when factual accuracy or completeness is low
   - ReformulationStrategy - rewrites the response when logical coherence is low
   - RestructuringStrategy - reorganizes the response for better flow
   - FactCheckingStrategy - corrects factual errors

3. Create an iterative improvement loop that continues until quality threshold is met or max iterations reached

# Test Strategy:
Test each improvement strategy with responses that have specific issues. Verify that the system correctly identifies the appropriate strategy based on evaluation results. Test the iterative improvement process to ensure it converges on better responses. Compare before/after responses to measure improvement.
