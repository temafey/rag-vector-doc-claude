What works:
- Core RAG pipeline (ingest, chunk, embed, search, answer)
- Multilingual support (en/ru)
- API and CLI for all major ops
- Agent/planning/evaluation endpoints
- Dockerized dev and prod
What's left:
- More tests (unit/integration)
- More doc formats (audio, images?)
- Performance tuning (Qdrant, chunking)
- UX polish (API docs, CLI help)
Known issues:
- Some edge cases in doc parsing
- Limited language support (only en/ru)
- Needs more robust error handling/logging

Current status:
- Project is in active development phase.
- Core functionalities are implemented and tested.
- Additional features and improvements are planned.

Evolution of project decisions:
- Initial project setup and core functionality development.
- Focus on multilingual support and API development.
- Expanding to include more document formats and performance tuning.
- UX improvements and error handling/logging enhancements.

Next steps:
- Implement more tests and expand language support.
- Focus on performance tuning and UX improvements.
- Continue with planned features and error handling/logging enhancements.
